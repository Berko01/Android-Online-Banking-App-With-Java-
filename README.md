# Android Online Banking App

## Overview

This Android application is developed in Java as part of the Android Programming course. The primary goal of this program is to implement a banking system, utilizing a custom API developed for this purpose. In this application, users can register with the bank, log in, and access financial data even without logging in. Upon logging in, users can view their accounts, create new accounts, access payment history, and view transfer history.
